# package-programming-js

Programming package for the [Fōrmulæ](https://formulae.org) programming language.

Fōrmulæ is also a software framework for visualization, edition and manipulation of complex expressions, from many fields. The code for an specific field —i.e. arithmetics— is encapsulated in a single unit called a Fōrmulæ **package**.

This repository contains the source code for the **programming package**. It constains visualization and reduction for structured programming expressions.

The GitHub organization [formulae-org](https://github.com/formulae-org) encompasses the source code for the rest of packages, as well as the [web application](https://github.com/formulae-org/formulae-js).

<!--
Take a look at this [tutorial](https://formulae.org/?script=tutorials/Complex) to know the capabilities of the Fōrmulæ arithmetic package.

### Capabilities ###

Visualization in two styles (flowchart and indented code), and reduction of the following expressions:

* Block
* If-then
* Inverted-If
* If-then-else
* Conditional
* Conditional switch
* Comparative switch
* Repeat for times
* Repeat from to
